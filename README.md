## Welcome to your Accelerated JS/TS course playground!

The following are instructions how to install the playground and use it.

All source code goes to the `src` directory. Your homeworks, tasks etc.

Now let's get to installing the playground. But first make sure to clone this repository

### 0. Make sure you have Node.js installed

Otherwise you're good.

### 1. Clone the repository

git clone https://github.com/bugron/accelerated-js-course-playground.git
```

or

### How to check your homework (or any other code for that matter)?

Just copy-paste your code into the `./src/index.ts` file and run `npm start` from the root of the repository. DO NOT commit your changes in `index.ts` file.
